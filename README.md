# I made a pomodoro application

When I want to get things accomplished I use pomodoro apps to study or complete a task in a efficient way. I thought it would be fun, if I made my own version of a pomodoro app. It is a very bare-bones project and is not too complex. It allows a user to set a study time and a break time, start and stop the timer, and reset the timer.
